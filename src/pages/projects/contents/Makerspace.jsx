                                        <p>This project is a modern Makerspace for public use. The site is along the Lachine Canal between Montreal Old-Port and Griffintown. This is a forward-thinking civic building proposal. Historically, Montrealâ€™s Old Port was a robust industrial engine and hub of manufacturing activity. Lachine Canal, a major shipping and transportation artery facilitated the expansion of light industry in the area throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>

                                        <p>Making / Sharing / Learning Makerspaces are creative spaces that are often located in communities, schools, as well as public and academic libraries. These areas are designed to engage participants in hands-on activities that teach twenty-first-century skills. The emphasis in makerspaces is placed upon educating students in STEM subjects as well as digital and information literacy. 
                                        Furthermore, the collaborative nature of makerspaces encourages the development of ideas through an ongoing exchange of ideas. New models of light industry are well served in makerspace environments (blockchain, robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, media arts) and coexist alongside old models of light industry (fashion, industrial design, metalworking, furniture making).</p>

                                        <p>De la Commune West and Bonaventure Highway. The site acts as a hinge between two historical parts of the city separated by Bonaventure Highway. The highway already underwent massive changes. In the last 10 years the city worked on bringing this elevated main access to the city on the ground level. This move is part of the desire to link both neighbourhoods into a more coherent whole. </p>
